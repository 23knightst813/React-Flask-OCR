# React-Flask-OCR

This project is designed to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on uploaded images using a full-stack architecture. The frontend is built with React, while the backend is powered by Flask. The OCR functionality is delivered through a custom-trained AI model, providing efficient text extraction from images.

## Features

- Extracts text from uploaded images via OCR.
- AI model trained in-house specifically for this project.
- Frontend built with React for a responsive and user-friendly interface.
- Backend developed with Flask, handling OCR operations and image processing.
- Supports image upload and displays extracted text results in real-time.

## External Libraries

- **React** - Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **Flask** - Backend framework for handling API requests and OCR processing.

## Dataset Acknowledgement

This project utilizes the MNIST dataset, a widely used benchmark in the field of machine learning for training the OCR model. The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 handwritten digits, providing a solid foundation for training the AI model specifically for text extraction tasks.
